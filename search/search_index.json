The Cognito User Pool will store user profile information and provide sign-up and sign-in capabilities, with the Cognito Identity Pool providing the ability to assume an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role from within the application. Since Wild Rydes is a ride sharing application, a key requirement is that all users must sign-up and sign-in before they're allowed to request a ride. You will configure the application to integrate with Amazon Cognito for these purposes via the AWS Amplify JavaScript library. Architecture The architecture for this module is very straightforward. All of your static web content including HTML, CSS JavaScript, images and other files will be served locally from your Cloud9 workspace. As you make changes to the website application code, all changes will be automatically updated and shown in your browser via live reload capabilities. For this module, we will be creating a Cognito User Pool as our secure user directory then configuring our application to use the AWS Amplify library to easily integrate Amazon Cognito into our application. Run the website locally From your Cloud9 workspace, select the terminal window and when you are within your ~/environment/aws-serverless-workshops/Auth/website directory, run the following command to start the local web server yarn start Wait for the development server to start. You can ignore any message saying Compiled with warnings as we will resolve these warnings as we add our functionality to the application. Now that the development server has started, click Preview Running Application in the top of the screen next to the Run button. The web application will load in a small window next to the terminal at the bottom of the Cloud9 IDE. Click the re-size button next to the word Browser to open this window in a new tab. As you make changes to the web application, this tab will automatically refresh to reflect your changes. Leave this tab open and return to the Cloud9 IDE tab to continue the workshop. Though the Wild Rydes website may look functional, there is currently no integration for sign-up or sign-in requests to go anywhere. Create a Cognito User Pool Amazon Cognito User Pools lets you add user sign-up and sign-in capabilities to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. In this step, we'll create a Cognito user pool for our Wild Rydes app. Use the AWS console to create an Amazon Cognito User Pool requiring e-mail verification. The console's region will default to the last region you were using previously. Change this to the same region where you launched your Cloud9 environment previously. In the AWS Management Console choose Services then select Cognito under Security, Identity, and Compliance. Choose your desired Region in top-right of the console if not already selected. This should match the region where you launched your Cloud9 environment previously. Choose Manage User Pools . Choose Create a User Pool in the top right of the console. Provide a name for your user pool such as WildRydes . Choose Step through settings to configure our user pool options. Leave Username selected, but additionally select Also allow sign in with verified email address and Also allow sign in with verified phone number . Leave all other attribute defaults as-is. Choose Next step . Leave password policies and user sign up settings set to default settings and choose Next step . Leave MFA set to Off for this workshop. Leave the default setting selected of requiring e-mail verification. Choose Next step . Leave all message and SES defaults as-is and choose Next step . Skip adding any tags and click Next step . Choose No to not remember your user's devices then click Next step . In the next screen, click the Add an app client link . Input wildrydes-web-app as the app client name. Uncheck Generate client secret . Client secrets are used for server-side applications authentication and are not needed for JavaScript applications. Choose Create app client . Choose Next step . Leave all Lambda trigger settings set to none . These trigger settings allow you to extend the out-of-the-box sign-up and sign-in flows with your own custom logic, but we will not be using this feature in this workshop. Choose Next step . Review summary of all provided settings for accuracy then choose Create pool . Within Cloud9, click the + symbol and choose to create New File . You will use this new blank editor tab as a scratchpad for various resource names and variables. Back in the AWS Cognito console, copy your new User Pool Id into the scratchpad tab. Choose App clients heading under General settings within the Cognito navigation panel. Copy the App client ID over to your scratchpad. You will be using both of these values later on. Create a Cognito Identity Pool Cognito Identity Pools are used to provide AWS credentials via IAM roles to end-user applications. Since we'll be integrating our Cognito deployment and users with other AWS services, we'll go ahead and create this identity pool now. You will need to create a Cognito Identity Pool linked to the Cognito User Pool and app client ID you just created. Your application will not require un-authenticated users to access any AWS resources, so you do not need to enable access to unauthenticated identities. In the Cognito console, choose Federated Identities in the header bar to switch to the console for Cognito Federated Identities. Choose Create new Identity pool . Input wildrydes_identity_pool as the Identity pool name. Expand Authentication providers . Within the Cognito tab, input the User Pool ID and App client Id you copied previously to the scratchpad tab. Choose Create Pool . Choose Allow to allow Cognito Identity Pools to setup IAM roles for your application's users. Permissions and settings of these roles can be customized later. Copy/paste the Identity Pool ID , highlighted in red within the code sample in the Get AWS Credentials section, into your Cloud9 scatchpad editor tab. Do not copy the quotation marks, but include the region code and \":\" character. Your scratchpad should now have values for the following Cognito resources: Integrate your application with Amazon Cognito Now that you've created and configured your Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool, you need to configure your application to integrate to Amazon Cognito so it can store user profiles and enable sign-up and sign-in. You will import the AWS Amplify JavaScript library into the project then add sign-up and sign-in utility classes to integrate with our existing UI and front-end components. You'll need to complete the implementation of the onSubmitForm and onSubmitVerification methods within the /Auth/website/src/auth/signIn.js file, as well as the methods of the same name within the /Auth/website/src/auth/signUp.js file. Finally, you'll need to complete the implementation of a method to check whether the user is authenticated within the /Auth/website/src/index.js page. Before using any AWS Amplify modules, we first need to configure Amplify to use our newly created Cognito resources by updating /Auth/website/src/amplify-config.js . After opening this file in your Cloud9 IDE editor, copy the following parameter values from your previous scratchpad into the config value parameter placeholders: identityPoolId region userPoolId userPoolWebClientId Be sure to fill in the '' blanks with your config values. You do not need to modify the example values shown in the comments as they are just for reference and not leveraged by your application. Save your changes to the Amplify config file so your new settings take effect. Any unsaved changes to a file are indicated by a dot icon in the tab of the editor so if you see a gray dot next to the file name, you may have forgotten to save. Next, edit the website/src/index.js file to add the following lines to the top of the file (but below all the other imports) to configure Amplify then save your changes: import Amplify from aws-amplify ; import awsConfig from ./amplify-config ; Amplify . configure ( awsConfig ); After making this changes, your imports should be in the following order: Save your changes to the website/src/index.js file. Next, we need to ensure our application evaluates the user's authenticated state. In the same /website/src/index.js file, find and replace the isAuthenticated method with the code below to use our Amplify library's built-in user session to check this status. const isAuthenticated = () = Amplify . Auth . user !== null ; Save your changes to the /website/src/index.js file. Now that we've imported the Amplify and configured the Amplify library, we need to update our application's code to sign-up users using Amplify and Cognito User Pools by finding and replacing the following methods within the /website/src/auth/SignUp.js file with the following code. Only replace the following two methods. The rest of the SignUp.js file should not be modified The onSubmitForm method handles the event when the registration form is submitted. This calls the Auth.signUp method from the AWS Amplify library which registers the user with your Cognito User Pool. The onSubmitVerification method handles the event when the verification code entry form is submitted after the initial registration request. This calls the Auth.confirmSignUp method from the AWS Amplify library which confirms the user registration within your Cognito User Pool. async onSubmitForm ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const params = { username : this . state . email . replace ( /[@.]/g , | ), password : this . state . password , attributes : { email : this . state . email , phone_number : this . state . phone }, validationData : [] }; const data = await Auth . signUp ( params ); console . log ( data ); this . setState ({ stage : 1 }); } catch ( err ) { if ( err === No userPool ) { // User pool not defined in Amplify config file console . error ( User Pool not defined ); alert ( User Pool not defined. Amplify config must be updated with user pool config ); } else if ( err . message === User already exists ) { // Setting state to allow user to proceed to enter verification code this . setState ({ stage : 1 }); } else { if ( err . message . indexOf ( phone number format ) = 0 ) { err . message = Invalid phone number format. Must include country code. Example: +14252345678 } alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Exception from Auth.signUp: , err ); this . setState ({ stage : 0 , email : , password : , confirm : }); } } } async onSubmitVerification ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const data = await Auth . confirmSignUp ( this . state . email . replace ( /[@.]/g , | ), this . state . code ); console . log ( data ); // Go to the sign in page this . props . history . replace ( /signin ); } catch ( err ) { alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Exception from Auth.confirmSignUp: , err ); } } Save your changes to the /website/src/auth/SignUp.js file. You additionally need to integrate the sign-in capability to use AWS Amplify and Cognito by finding and replacing the following methods within the /website/src/auth/SignIn.js file with the code below. You only need to the following two methods. The rest of the SignIn.js file should not be modified. The onSubmitForm method initiates the signin request with your Cognito User Pool by invoking the Auth.signIn method from AWS Amplify then sets the local state appropriately to indicate the user has signed in successfully. The onSubmitVerification method is used to submit a verification code whenever multi-factor authentication is required to authenticate. For this workshop, this method will not be invoked since you did not require multi-factor authentication earlier when configuring your Cognito User Pool. async onSubmitForm ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const userObject = await Auth . signIn ( this . state . email . replace ( /[@.]/g , | ), this . state . password ); console . log ( userObject , userObject ); if ( userObject . challengeName ) { // Auth challenges are pending prior to token issuance this . setState ({ userObject , stage : 1 }); } else { // No remaining auth challenges need to be satisfied const session = await Auth . currentSession (); // console.log( Cognito User Access Token: , session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken()); console . log ( Cognito User Identity Token: , session . getIdToken (). getJwtToken ()); // console.log( Cognito User Refresh Token , session.getRefreshToken().getToken()); this . setState ({ stage : 0 , email : , password : , code : }); this . props . history . replace ( /app ); } } catch ( err ) { alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Auth.signIn(): , err ); } } async onSubmitVerification ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const data = await Auth . confirmSignIn ( this . state . userObject , this . state . code ); console . log ( Cognito User Data: , data ); const session = await Auth . currentSession (); // console.log( Cognito User Access Token: , session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken()); console . log ( Cognito User Identity Token: , session . getIdToken (). getJwtToken ()); // console.log( Cognito User Refresh Token , session.getRefreshToken().getToken()); this . setState ({ stage : 0 , email : , password : , code : }); this . props . history . replace ( /app ); } catch ( err ) { alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Auth.confirmSignIn(): , err ); } } Save your changes to the /website/src/auth/SignIn.js file. Validate sign-up and sign-in Now that you have integrated our Amplify code into our application, you need to test the site to see that authentication is working end-to-end. Return to your browser tab where you started your Wild Rydes application earlier after popping out from the Cloud9 IDE once in preview mode. This page automatically refreshes after you save any code changes so should now reflect all of your changes and be ready for testing. Visit the /register path to sign-up as a new user, providing a valid phone number with +country_code first preceeding the number. For a US-based phone number, an example would be +14251234567 . You should then see that a verification message is sent with a one-time code upon registering, which is required before you're able to sign-in. After signing up as a new user, sign-in with the same user at the /signin path. If the page loads a map, sign-in was successful and you have successfully integrated Cognito for app authentication. Visit /register path of your Cloud9's website to go to the registration page. Input your e-mail address, phone number with +country_code first preceeding the number, as well as your password twice. For a US-based phone number, an example would be +14251234567 . Your password must include 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase characters, and at least 1 number and 1 special character. Choose Let's Ryde to submit registration. On the verify e-mail screen, enter the one-time code sent to your e-mail address provided then choose Verify . Be sure to check your spam folder for the e-mail with your verification code if you do not see it in your inbox. Assuming no errors were encountered, you will be redirected to the Sign-in screen. Now, re-enter the same e-mail address and password you chose at registration. If the page then loads a map, sign-in was successful and you have successfully integrated Cognito for app authentication. Scroll down beyond the map to copy your user's identity token and decode it by pasting it into the 'encoded' input box at JWT.io . You will see all of your user's attributes are encoded within the token, along with other standard attributes such as the time the token was issued, the time the token expires, the user's unique ID, and more. Once you have finished setting up the user authentication, you can proceed to the next module.","title":"Module 1: User authentication"},{"location":"01-user-auth/#module-1-user-authentication","text":"Time : 20 minutes In this module, you will create an Amazon Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool for the Wild Rydes application.

Copy/paste the Identity Pool ID , highlighted in red within the code sample in the Get AWS Credentials section, into your Cloud9 scatchpad editor tab. Do not copy the quotation marks, but include the region code and \":\" character. Your scratchpad should now have values for the following Cognito resources:","title":"Create a Cognito Identity Pool"},{"location":"01-user-auth/#integrate-your-application-with-amazon-cognito","text":"Now that you've created and configured your Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool, you need to configure your application to integrate to Amazon Cognito so it can store user profiles and enable sign-up and sign-in. You will import the AWS Amplify JavaScript library into the project then add sign-up and sign-in utility classes to integrate with our existing UI and front-end components. You'll need to complete the implementation of the onSubmitForm and onSubmitVerification methods within the /Auth/website/src/auth/signIn.js file, as well as the methods of the same name within the /Auth/website/src/auth/signUp.js file. Finally, you'll need to complete the implementation of a method to check whether the user is authenticated within the /Auth/website/src/index.js page. Before using any AWS Amplify modules, we first need to configure Amplify to use our newly created Cognito resources by updating /Auth/website/src/amplify-config.js . After opening this file in your Cloud9 IDE editor, copy the following parameter values from your previous scratchpad into the config value parameter placeholders: identityPoolId region userPoolId userPoolWebClientId Be sure to fill in the '' blanks with your config values. You do not need to modify the example values shown in the comments as they are just for reference and not leveraged by your application. Save your changes to the Amplify config file so your new settings take effect. Any unsaved changes to a file are indicated by a dot icon in the tab of the editor so if you see a gray dot next to the file name, you may have forgotten to save. Next, edit the website/src/index.js file to add the following lines to the top of the file (but below all the other imports) to configure Amplify then save your changes: import Amplify from aws-amplify ; import awsConfig from ./amplify-config ; Amplify . configure ( awsConfig ); After making this changes, your imports should be in the following order: Save your changes to the website/src/index.js file. Next, we need to ensure our application evaluates the user's authenticated state. In the same /website/src/index.js file, find and replace the isAuthenticated method with the code below to use our Amplify library's built-in user session to check this status. const isAuthenticated = () = Amplify . Auth . user !== null ; Save your changes to the /website/src/index.js file. Now that we've imported the Amplify and configured the Amplify library, we need to update our application's code to sign-up users using Amplify and Cognito User Pools by finding and replacing the following methods within the /website/src/auth/SignUp.js file with the following code. Only replace the following two methods. The rest of the SignUp.js file should not be modified The onSubmitForm method handles the event when the registration form is submitted. This calls the Auth.signUp method from the AWS Amplify library which registers the user with your Cognito User Pool. The onSubmitVerification method handles the event when the verification code entry form is submitted after the initial registration request. This calls the Auth.confirmSignUp method from the AWS Amplify library which confirms the user registration within your Cognito User Pool. async onSubmitForm ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const params = { username : this . state . email . replace ( /[@.]/g , | ), password : this . state . password , attributes : { email : this . state . email , phone_number : this . state . phone }, validationData : [] }; const data = await Auth . signUp ( params ); console . log ( data ); this . setState ({ stage : 1 }); } catch ( err ) { if ( err === No userPool ) { // User pool not defined in Amplify config file console . error ( User Pool not defined ); alert ( User Pool not defined. Amplify config must be updated with user pool config ); } else if ( err . message === User already exists ) { // Setting state to allow user to proceed to enter verification code this . setState ({ stage : 1 }); } else { if ( err . message . indexOf ( phone number format ) = 0 ) { err . message = Invalid phone number format. Must include country code. Example: +14252345678 } alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Exception from Auth.signUp: , err ); this . setState ({ stage : 0 , email : , password : , confirm : }); } } } async onSubmitVerification ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const data = await Auth . confirmSignUp ( this . state . email . replace ( /[@.]/g , | ), this . state . code ); console . log ( data ); // Go to the sign in page this . props . history . replace ( /signin ); } catch ( err ) { alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Exception from Auth.confirmSignUp: , err ); } } Save your changes to the /website/src/auth/SignUp.js file. You additionally need to integrate the sign-in capability to use AWS Amplify and Cognito by finding and replacing the following methods within the /website/src/auth/SignIn.js file with the code below. You only need to the following two methods. The rest of the SignIn.js file should not be modified. The onSubmitForm method initiates the signin request with your Cognito User Pool by invoking the Auth.signIn method from AWS Amplify then sets the local state appropriately to indicate the user has signed in successfully. The onSubmitVerification method is used to submit a verification code whenever multi-factor authentication is required to authenticate. For this workshop, this method will not be invoked since you did not require multi-factor authentication earlier when configuring your Cognito User Pool. async onSubmitForm ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const userObject = await Auth . signIn ( this . state . email . replace ( /[@.]/g , | ), this . state . password ); console . log ( userObject , userObject ); if ( userObject . challengeName ) { // Auth challenges are pending prior to token issuance this . setState ({ userObject , stage : 1 }); } else { // No remaining auth challenges need to be satisfied const session = await Auth . currentSession (); // console.log( Cognito User Access Token: , session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken()); console . log ( Cognito User Identity Token: , session . getIdToken (). getJwtToken ()); // console.log( Cognito User Refresh Token , session.getRefreshToken().getToken()); this . setState ({ stage : 0 , email : , password : , code : }); this . props . history . replace ( /app ); } } catch ( err ) { alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Auth.signIn(): , err ); } } async onSubmitVerification ( e ) { e . preventDefault (); try { const data = await Auth . confirmSignIn ( this . state . userObject , this . state . code ); console . log ( Cognito User Data: , data ); const session = await Auth . currentSession (); // console.log( Cognito User Access Token: , session.getAccessToken().getJwtToken()); console . log ( Cognito User Identity Token: , session . getIdToken (). getJwtToken ()); // console.log( Cognito User Refresh Token , session.getRefreshToken().getToken()); this . setState ({ stage : 0 , email : , password : , code : }); this . props . history . replace ( /app ); } catch ( err ) { alert ( err . message ); console . error ( Auth.confirmSignIn(): , err ); } } Save your changes to the /website/src/auth/SignIn.js file.","title":"Integrate your application with Amazon Cognito"},{"location":"01-user-auth/#validate-sign-up-and-sign-in","text":"Now that you have integrated our Amplify code into our application, you need to test the site to see that authentication is working end-to-end. Return to your browser tab where you started your Wild Rydes application earlier after popping out from the Cloud9 IDE once in preview mode. This page automatically refreshes after you save any code changes so should now reflect all of your changes and be ready for testing. Visit the /register path to sign-up as a new user, providing a valid phone number with +country_code first preceeding the number. For a US-based phone number, an example would be +14251234567 . You should then see that a verification message is sent with a one-time code upon registering, which is required before you're able to sign-in. After signing up as a new user, sign-in with the same user at the /signin path. If the page loads a map, sign-in was successful and you have successfully integrated Cognito for app authentication. Visit /register path of your Cloud9's website to go to the registration page. Input your e-mail address, phone number with +country_code first preceeding the number, as well as your password twice. For a US-based phone number, an example would be +14251234567 . Your password must include 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase characters, and at least 1 number and 1 special character. Choose Let's Ryde to submit registration. On the verify e-mail screen, enter the one-time code sent to your e-mail address provided then choose Verify . Be sure to check your spam folder for the e-mail with your verification code if you do not see it in your inbox. Assuming no errors were encountered, you will be redirected to the Sign-in screen. Now, re-enter the same e-mail address and password you chose at registration. If the page then loads a map, sign-in was successful and you have successfully integrated Cognito for app authentication. Scroll down beyond the map to copy your user's identity token and decode it by pasting it into the 'encoded' input box at JWT.io . You will see all of your user's attributes are encoded within the token, along with other standard attributes such as the time the token was issued, the time the token expires, the user's unique ID, and more. Once you have finished setting up the user authentication, you can proceed to the next module.","title":"Validate sign-up and sign-in"},{"location":"02-backend-auth/","text":"Module 1 Backend authorization Time : 15 minutes In this module, you will add a serverless backend to your Wild Rydes application leveraging Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda . You will then enable authentication and authorization on your API to secure the backend to only accept valid, authorized requests. Architecture Building on Module 1, this module will add a Serverless backend built using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. For persistence, you will use Amazon DynamoDB as a NoSQL data store. All of the above services are serverless so you can seamlessly scale your application as your demands grow. After creating the API, we will integrate our client application to call it via the AWS Amplify library. Launch the Serverless API backend You will be creating your Serverless API built with Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB via a CloudFormation template. Since this workshop is focused on authentication and authorization, this template will create the backend infrastructure, but not enable any security settings and the rest of the module will enable and configure such settings. Create a new WildRydes Serverless Backend stack by launching a CloudFormation stack based on the ServerlessBackend.yaml file in the module 2 folder. Name the stack WildRydesBackend . This WildRydes backend CloudFormation template will provision your API Gateway deployment with Lambda functions for compute, a DynamoDB database for persistence, and an S3 bucket for photo uploads which will be used in module 3. Additionally, the necessary function invocation permissions and execution role for the Lambda function will also be provisioned. Region Deploy us-east-1 (N. Virginia) us-east-2 (Ohio) us-west-2 (Oregon) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. The Specify an Amazon S3 template URL is already selected and the template URL is automatically added. Click Next . On the Specify Details click Next . On the Options click Next (leave everything on this page as the default). On the Review page, choose to Acknowledge that the CloudFormation template may create IAM resources with custom names , review the summary details, and then click Create stack . It will take a few minutes for the Stack to create. Choose the Stack Info tab to go to the overall stack status page and wait until the stack is fully launched and shows a status of CREATE_COMPLETE . Click the refresh icon periodically to see progress update. With the WildRydesBackend stack selected, click on the Outputs tab and copy the value shown for the WildRydesApiInvokeUrl to your Cloud9 scratchpad editor tab. Integrate your API Now that you have created our Serverless API, you need to update your Wild Rydes web application to integrate with it. You will leverage the AWS Amplify client library to make API calls and inject security seamlessly to support your authentication and authorization scenarios. First, expand your amplify-config.js file to store your new API Gateway endpoint. Next, within MainApp.js under pages, enable the hasAPI method by uncommenting its functionality. Additionally, update the getData method to capture the latitude and longitude selected on the map and send to the API as a PickupLocation object including both the latitude and longitude. First, you need to update the /website/src/amplify-config.js file to include your new API Gateway endpoint. Store the endpoint including the /prod at the end in the endpoint property under the WildRydesAPI section. Do not change the name WildRydesAPI in this configuration file. API: { endpoints: [ { name: WildRydesAPI , endpoint: https://1ngrgqjt6c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod , region: us-east-1 } ] }, Next, you need to enable the hasAPI method by uncommenting its code within /website/src/pages/MainApp.js . hasApi () { const api = awsConfig . API . endpoints . filter ( v = v . endpoint !== ); return ( typeof api !== undefined ); } Finally, within the same file, we will implement the API request for a ride as a POST request to our API which sends a body containing the requested latitude and longitude as the pickup location. Update the getData() method to be as follows: async getData ( pin ) { const apiRequest = { body : { PickupLocation : { Longitude : pin . longitude , Latitude : pin . latitude } }, headers : { Authorization : , // To be updated Content-Type : application/json } }; console . log ( API Request: , apiRequest ); return await API . post ( apiName , apiPath , apiRequest ); } Validate API functionality and integration Now that you've integrated code changes to call your new Serverless API, you should test the end-to-end user experience to ensure the application is working correctly. The API currently requires no authentication so any request will currently be accepted until we enable required authentication. Go back to your browser tab with Wild Rydes running and sign-in again at /signin . Once signed in, click anywhere on the map to indicate a pickup location, then select the Request button to call your ride. You should be informed of your unicorn's arrival momentarily. Enable API Gateway authorization Amazon API Gateway can use the JSON Web tokens (JWT) returned by Cognito User Pools to authenticate API calls. In this step, you'll configure an authorizer for your API to use the user pool you created in module 1 . Since Cognito User Pools implements OpenID Connect JSON web tokens, API Gateway is able to compare the signature of an access or identity token against the known public keys of the Cognito User Pool which allows verification and authentication to happen without having to write additional code in your application. In the Amazon API Gateway console, create a new Cognito user pool authorizer for your API. Configure it to use the user pool that you created in the previous module. You can test the configuration in the console by copying and pasting the identity token printed to the console after you log in via the /signin path of your current website. Once setup, you will change your application's code to send the proper JSON web token with its API requests to authenticate. In the AWS Management Console choose Services then select API Gateway under Networking and Content Delivery. Choose the API named WildRydes . Under your newly created API, choose Authorizers . Chose Create New Authorizer . Enter WildRydes for the Authorizer name. Select Cognito for the type. In the Region drop-down under Cognito User Pool , select the Region where you created your Cognito user pool in the last module (by default the current region should be selected). Enter WildRydes (or the name you gave your user pool) in the Cognito User Pool input. Enter Authorization for the Token Source . Leave Token Validation blank without editing. Choose Create . Verify your authorizer configuration In a different browser tab, return to your Wild Rydes application and sign-in if you're not already signed in. After signing in, you should be redirected to /app . Open your browser's developer console and browse to the console log output section. Look for the console log to say Cognito User Identity Token: and a long string beneath the message. Copy the long string to your clipboard without the intro message. You will need to copy across multiple lines to fully copy the token in its entirety. Go back to previous tab where you have just finished creating the Authorizer. Click Test at the bottom of the card for the authorizer. Paste the auth token into the Authorization Token field in the popup dialog. Click Test button and verify that the response code is 200 and that you see the claims for your user displayed. Since this is the identity token, the user's attributes are encoded within the JWT as claims which can be read parsed programatically. If you do not receive successful test results as shown below, do not proceed until you're able to validate the authorizer is configured properly and passes this test. Require Cognito authentication for API Gateway Browse to Resources while within your Wild Rydes API in the API Gateway console. Select the POST method under the /ride resource path. Choose Method Request Choose the pencil icon next to Authorization to edit the setting. Select your new Cognito Authorizer from the list of options presented. If you don't see this option listed, Reload the browser page then this authorizer option should appear in the drop-down list. Save your selection by clicking the checkmark icon next to the drop down. Next, choose the Actions button at the top of the resources list. Choose Deploy API from the list of options presented. For deployment stage, select prod then click Deploy . You've now successfully deployed your new authentication integration to your API's production environment. Configure your Wild Rydes web app to authenticate API requests Now that you've deployed the new authorizer configuration to production, all API requests must be authenticated to be processed. Return to your Wild Rydes app, sign in at /signin if necessary, and attempt to request a ride. You should receive an Error finding unicorn . If you open the developer console, you will see that we received a HTTP 401 error, which means it was an unauthorized request. To authenticate our requests properly, we need to send an Authorization header. If you at first still that you requests go through without any errors, try requesting a ride again in 30-60 seconds to allow the API Gateway changes to fully propagate. Go back to Cloud9 and open the /website/src/pages/MainApp.js files. Browse down to the getData method you previously updated. You will notice that the headers for the request currently include a blank Authorization header. Replace your current getData method with the following code which sends your user's Cognito identity token, encoded as a JSON web token, in the Authorization header with every request. async getData ( pin ) { const apiRequest = { body : { PickupLocation : { Longitude : pin . longitude , Latitude : pin . latitude } }, headers : { Authorization : this . state . idToken , Content-Type : application/json } }; console . log ( API Request: , apiRequest ); return await API . post ( apiName , apiPath , apiRequest ); } Allow the application to refresh, sign-in again, and request a ride. The unicorn ride request should be fulfilled as before now. To see the full request headers which were sent, look at the developer console for an API Request informational message which includes the API Request details once expanded, including the full headers and body of the request.

Amazon Cognito will be used to store your user's profile information and custom attributes whereas Amazon S3 will store your user's profile pictures, with a link to the photo only being stored in the user's profile directly. Architecture Building on Modules 1 and 2, this module will add photo storage and management via an Amazon S3 bucket. For AWS resource access from a web application, Amazon Cognito will issue not only JWTs as we saw earlier, but then also allow users to assume an IAM role from within the application. This AWS IAM role will then allow their application to securely connect to upload and download photos from S3 (though any other AWS API would also work with this capability). To secure access to the photo storage and bucket, you will leverage IAM policies for fine-grained control. Setup S3 bucket for use with AWS Amplify You will need to configure AWS Amplify to securely store profile images in an S3 bucket. To save time, the Serverless Backend CloudFormation template that created the serverless backend API for this workshop also created an S3 bucket for this purpose with the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings already set. You just need to associate this bucket with your application's code. Browse to your CloudFormation stack created in the earlier modules and find the name of the S3 bucket under Outputs. Once you have the name, open your amplify-config.js file again and update the storage section with the bucket's name and region. Go the AWS Management Console, click Services then select CloudFormation under Management Tools. In the CloudFormation console, click on your Wild Rydes stack name, such as WildRydesBackend . Click on the Outputs tab. Copy your bucket name to your clipboard. It is the name shown under Value for the key called WildRydesProfilePicturesBucket .

You need to next update our roles to have policies that grant access to our S3 photo bucket. Browse to the IAM console and find your Cognito Identity Pool's authenticated user role. Create an in-line policy on this role which provides for S3 bucket protected and private-level access per-user by leveraging IAM policy variables. Go the AWS Management Console, click Services then select IAM under Security, Identity, and Compliance. Choose Roles . Search for WildRydes to find the two roles which were created by Cognito Identity Pools when you created the Identity Pool in module one. Should you not be able to find the roles here, you can alternatively go to the Cognito Federated Identities console, find the correct identity pool, then click Edit Identity Pool in the top-right corner to see the roles listed. Each identity pool has both an Unauthenticated user role and an Authenticated user role. Once you have found the names of the roles, go back to the IAM console and select the Auth role for your authenticated users. If the full name of the role is hidden from view due to column width, you can hover over the partially visible name of the role to see the full name of the role as a tool tip. We want to grant permissions to this role explicitly so we will use an inline policy, which would be deleted with this role if it were ever to be deleted. Choose Add inline policy on the right-hand side to create a new inline policy associated to this IAM role. Choose the JSON tab to allow you to free-form edit the new policy. Paste the following IAM policy statements for S3 access. After pasting, you will need to go replace the bucket name listed in all caps with your bucket name (a total of 4 times). Be sure to leave the parts of the resource names before and after the replacement value alone and not accidentally modify them. The following policy makes use of IAM policy variables where ${aws:userid} represents the current authenticated user's unique Cognito identity ID. This policy's effective permissions will allow all authenticated users to read objects from the root of the bucket and any /protected path, but only allow users to read their own private sub-path and write to their sub-path within the protected path. These are default paths that are integrated with AWS Amplify to easily set file access levels . { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:PutObject\", \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:GetObjectVersion\", \"s3:DeleteObject\", \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/private/${aws:userid}/*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:GetObjectVersion\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/protected/*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:PutObject\", \"s3:DeleteObject\", \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/protected/${aws:userid}/*\" }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:PutObject\", \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:GetObjectVersion\", \"s3:DeleteObject\", \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/public/*\" } ] } 1. Choose Review policy . Name the policy WildRydes-S3Access . After reviewing for accuracy and any syntax errors, choose Create policy . Update application to upload photos Now that your IAM policies and Amplify SDK are initialized, you will be able to upload photos and render S3 photos with minimal code using Amplify's built-in UI components. S3 image is the component used to both render image objects for a React application, as well as embeding an image picker to help with uploads. High-Level Instructions Authenticate in the Wild Rydes app if you're not already logged in, then browse to the /profile path. You will see that your Cognito User Pool attributes are being read dynamically by the system. Next, you will add an image picker from AWS Amplify to render a UI component for uploading and displaying photos stored in S3. These profile photos will be used to personalize the rider experience so unicorns know who to look for when picking up passengers. Step-by-step instructions (expand for details) 1. After logging in to Wild Rydes (if you're not authenticated already), browse to the **/profile** path. 1. You should see that your e-mail address and phone number you registered with are displayed which are all of your currently populated attributes. 1. Open your Cloud9 IDE environment and open the file at */website/src/pages/Profile.js*. 1. **Uncomment** the line that says *S3Image*. This instantiates an Amplify UI component for React apps for image rendering and uploading and only requires this single line of code. 1. Go back to the Wild Rydes app and visit the **/profile** path after logging in. You should now be able to upload photos with the new image picker. ## Store profile picture links in Cognito User Pools profile With our image uploads now working, all will work as expected until you close your browser, but at that point the reference between your user profile and your profile picture will be lost. To fix this, you will leverage a Cognito User Pools user attribute called *picture* to persist the S3 object key so the same image can be loaded upon each login and persisted to be shown to the unicorns when you request a ride. You will need to update */website/src/pages/Profile.js* and a method called *onImageLoad* to make this possible. #### High-Level Instructions Implement a method to persist the images uploaded to the current user's Cognito *picture* attribute each time the image is changed. Step-by-step instructions (expand for details) 1. Open your Cloud9 IDE environment and open the file at */website/src/pages/Profile.js*. 1. The S3Image UI component has a built-in method called *onImageLoad* which provides in its invocation the full URL of any image uploaded. We will make use of this built-in function to persist our image URLs out to Cognito. 1. Replace the existing *onImageLoad* function with the following code: ``` async onImageLoad(url) { if (!this.state.user.getSession) { return }; console.log('Profile Picture URL:', url); try { let result = await Auth.updateUserAttributes(this.state.user, { 'picture': this.state.image_key }); console.log(result); } catch (ex) { console.error('Attribute update error:', ex); } } ``` 1. Now with this new method in place, upload a new photo after logging into Wild Rydes then close your browser. Open a new window and try logging in again. Your photo should load as it did previously. ## Conclusion Congratulations! You've completed the Wild Rydes Auth workshop. We hope that this time and interactive learning has been valuable for you. For further learning on this topic, please see our list of [Serverless Auth Resources](../Resources.md).

For AWS resource access from a web application, Amazon Cognito will issue not only JWTs as we saw earlier, but then also allow users to assume an IAM role from within the application. This AWS IAM role will then allow their application to securely connect to upload and download photos from S3 (though any other AWS API would also work with this capability).

To save time, the Serverless Backend CloudFormation template that created the serverless backend API for this workshop also created an S3 bucket for this purpose with the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings already set. You just need to associate this bucket with your application's code. Browse to your CloudFormation stack created in the earlier modules and find the name of the S3 bucket under Outputs. Once you have the name, open your amplify-config.js file again and update the storage section with the bucket's name and region. Go the AWS Management Console, click Services then select CloudFormation under Management Tools. In the CloudFormation console, click on your Wild Rydes stack name, such as WildRydesBackend . Click on the Outputs tab. Copy your bucket name to your clipboard. It is the name shown under Value for the key called WildRydesProfilePicturesBucket . Next, return to your Cloud9 IDE and open the file /website/src/amplify-config.js .
